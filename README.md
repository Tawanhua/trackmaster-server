The backend of the Task Manager Application is developed using Java with Spring Boot framework. It provides a RESTful API for managing tasks, allowing users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. The backend interacts with a MySQL database to store task-related data, including task titles, descriptions, due dates, and status.

## Project Description

The backend of the Task Manager Application is developed using Java with Spring Boot framework. It provides a RESTful API for managing tasks, allowing users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. The backend interacts with a MySQL database to store task-related data, including task titles, descriptions, due dates, and status.

Key Components:

* Spring Boot: Provides a lightweight framework for building Java-based web applications. It simplifies configuration and offers out-of-the-box features for rapid development.

* Spring Data JPA: Offers easy integration with JPA (Java Persistence API) for database access. It simplifies data access layer implementation by providing repositories and automatic CRUD operations.

* Spring MVC: Handles web requests and defines RESTful endpoints. Controllers are responsible for processing incoming requests, invoking appropriate service methods, and returning responses.

* MySQL Database: Stores task data in a relational database. Tables are defined to store task details such as title, description, due date, and status.
